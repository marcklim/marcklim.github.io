#A blog brought to you by GitHub and jekyll-now

I've been looking for a blogging platform for a while. I considered setting up another wordpress, using medium or LinkedIn. I was thinking for a moment that it would be cool to have something very simple where I write posts in markdown and use those for a blog. I was also thinking it would be cool to host the blog content on GitHub since I'm now pretty much part of the company and would like to get a couple more boxes on my contribution history. A google search and 10 mins later, here we are.

It's actually quite amazing how easy this was to set up. It's even more amazing how flexible this is - I did the entire setup from my iPad but I can work on posts offline and through the magic of git I can also develop pages offline and get good versioning. Updating the jekyll-now should be simple via a pull, I don't have to worry about keeping a server up to date and I don't need to install anything. 

All in all, I'm pretty impressed. A couple hours ago I would not have thought to be using GitHub in this way. Let's see how this does.

Quick update: I also got to use CodeSpaces to update the blog. That thing works well too.
