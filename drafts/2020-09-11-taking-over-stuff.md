title: Taking over stuff without having a goal - a bad idea?
---

I took over a large survey a while ago. And now I transitioned it. During our results meeting today, we are talking about what we do in November and December. And I suddenly realize: O shit, has it been a year?

I leared a stuff about qualtrics and statistics / data scieence
I learned how to make sense of stuff for myself
Was it worth it?
