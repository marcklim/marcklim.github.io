Microsoft has changed a lot. We now talk to BDM instead of TDM
- At ignite, we talked a lot about the biz implications of our product and a lot less about experiences for IT Pros and Devs
- Propos to Satya and the LT for changing the dialogue
- This means change for product managers
- It's not IT for IT's sake anymore but we still have to do all the groundwork


PM has changed
- from know it all to learn it all
- need to step up the game
- more alignment with the industry
- more alignment with the customer
- hard transition because there is little training material
- hard transition because engineering still is not there (know it all orgs, SWE and PM seem behind in thinking, Consulting and Sales seem to have an easier time)
