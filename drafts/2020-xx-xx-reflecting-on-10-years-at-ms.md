Microsoft has changed a lot. We now talk to BDM instead of TDM
- At ignite, we talked a lot about the biz implications of our product and a lot less about experiences for IT Pros and Devs
- Propos to Satya and the LT for changing the dialogue
- This means change for product managers
- It's not IT for IT's sake anymore but we still have to do all the groundwork


PM has changed
- from know it all to learn it all
- need to step up the game
- more alignment with the industry
- more alignment with the customer
- hard transition because there is little training material
- hard transition because engineering still is not there (know it all orgs, SWE and PM seem behind in thinking, Consulting and Sales seem to have an easier time)


Much more openness
- open to different platforms. I use an iPHone and a yubikey
- companies can keep working the way they have been working - e. g. GH
- openness to different personas - developers and non-developers, developed and developing countries

Tools have changed and there are a bunch of new tools
- It's not your dad's office nay more. SharePoint became OneDrive and teams. You have access on all devices
- Massive innovation, hard to keep track and stay up to date
- GitHub has come in, replacing Azure Dev Ops and doing things I didn't think it would do. And someitmes simple seems to be better
- Being open is becoming more important
